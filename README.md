## Project Topic and Description
Topic: Intelligent Dog Breed Recognition and Recommendation System
Description: The goal of our project is to develop a system that uses computer vision to automatically recognize the breed of a dog from an uploaded image. In addition, the system will provide information about the characteristics of the breed, suggest similar breeds based on these characteristics, and give recommendations (such as potential health-related specifics or care tips). Importance & Value:
-Many dog owners and adopters are unaware of the exact breed of their dog, which complicates proper care and medical attention.
-Our system can be useful for veterinarians, dog owners, adoption centers, and people who want to adopt a dog with certain characteristics.
-It combines education, pet care assistance, and convenience in one tool.
Target Users: Dog owners, veterinarians, adoption centers, pet enthusiasts.
